# CS253: Data Structures and Algorithms

This is an advanced course in computer science, studying computational methods to process data using various structures and algorithms. This course covers data structures such as heaps, trees, graphs as well as their applications in the construction of efficient algorithms for select, sort, balance, match, etc. Advanced topics such as dynamic programming, linear programming, and network flow are also discussed. Homework assignments require sufficient understanding in Java programming as well as Git version control, Gradle software project management, and Lambda serverless computing. Prerequisites: CS171.
